These files contain our code for the implementation pipeline of the Harry Potter research paper. Files should be run in the following order - 
(i) Finetuning-On-WikiTRUE
(ii) Creating-Synthetic-Dataset 

We progressed quite a lot in this pipeline, but ultimately had to abandon it as we ran into memory errors while running (ii) Creating-Synthetic-Dataset. We could generate only 2/5th of the required synthetic dataset.
